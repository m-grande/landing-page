        <div class="info-text">
            <p>Odin is one of the most complex and widely revered figures in Norse mythology, often referred to as the "All-Father" and the chief of the Æsir, the main tribe of Norse gods. His story is a tapestry woven with wisdom, sacrifice, war, magic, and poetry, making him a character of deep resonance and fascinating paradoxes.<br>
                What distinguishes Odin is his insatiable thirst for knowledge, a quest that led him to make unthinkable sacrifices. Perhaps the most well-known is his act of self-mutilation to drink from Mímir's Well. This well, guarded by the wise Mímir, contained all the wisdom of the cosmos. To even taste a single drop of this primordial knowledge, Odin offered one of his eyes, symbolizing his total dedication to understanding the secrets of the universe. This sacrifice was not an act of desperation, but of deliberate and profound determination, a price he was willing to pay to enlighten his mind and guide his people.<br>
                Another example of his quest for wisdom and power is his apprenticeship of the runes. To understand the mysteries of these powerful magical letters, Odin hung himself on the cosmic tree Yggdrasil for nine days and nine nights, wounded by his own spear, Gungnir. Through this shamanic ritual of suffering and self-sacrifice, Odin gained knowledge of the runes, which bestowed upon him immense power over magic, prophecy, and destiny. This period of voluntary suffering transformed him, granting him a vision that went beyond simple sensory perception, allowing him to decipher the whispers of fate itself.</p>

                    <h1>War and Death</h1>
                    <p>Odin is the lord of strategy and the destiny of warriors. His influence extends deeply onto the battlefields. It is his Valkyries who choose the most valiant among the fallen, bringing half of them to his majestic hall in Asgard: Valhalla. Here, the Einherjar feast and train incessantly, preparing for Ragnarök, the final battle where Odin will lead the Æsir. Valhalla is an eternal training ground, an antechamber to the great war, reflecting his vision as a far-sighted general who gathers his forces for the inevitable conflict.</p>

                <h1>Wisdom and Knowledge</h1>
                <p>Odin's insatiable thirst for wisdom is his most distinguishing characteristic, driving him to make immense sacrifices. His most famous act is sacrificing one of his eyes to drink from Mímir's Well. This well, guarded by the wise Mímir, contained all knowledge. In exchange for just one sip, Odin gave his eye, an irreversible pledge. This act not only granted him immense cosmic knowledge but also became a symbol of his absolute dedication to truth and his ability to see beyond the surface, despite imperfect physical vision. Odin's missing eye is a testament to the fact that true wisdom often demands personal sacrifice.</p>

                <h1>Poetry and Magic</h1>
                <p>Odin is deeply connected to poetry and magic, being the source of all true poetic inspiration and the master of powerful arcane arts. His mastery of runic magic is legendary. He gained knowledge of the runes through another act of self-sacrifice: he hung himself on Yggdrasil for nine days and nine nights, wounded by his own spear. In this shamanic trance, the runes revealed themselves to him, granting him authority over their magic, divination, and the control of events. He's also closely associated with seidr, a form of shamanic magic that included prophecy and the alteration of reality. His command of these arcane arts, combined with his profound wisdom, makes him a god of vast influence and mystery.</p>
